# üëã Hello, folks!

I am Efstathios, a computer scientist and a philosopher living in Greece. I have a passion for Software Engineering and Computational Intelligence.

## üí¨ About

In 2011 I received a B.Sc. degree in Informatics and Communications with a specialization in Software Engineering from the Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia, Greece. Additionally, in 2019 I received a M.Sc. degree in Informatics and Communications with a specialization in Computational Intelligence and Digital Media from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), Greece.

I have been working in the software development industry in Greece since 2010. Through these years I have gained professional experience in developing enterprise non-AI as well as AI software systems. Currently, I am working as a full-stack Machine / Deep Learning Engineer for Medoid AI and I have successfully managed to deliver various AI projects to clients worldwide both in cloud as well as on-premise environments.
